# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, implemented in Python.

Each day lives in its own script (for example, `day-01.py`) and typically reads its input from the corresponding file(s) under the `input/` directory.

## 🤖 AI

AI is used in a limit fashion, detailed below. These solutions are not intended for the leaderboard, nor are they even remotely able to get on the leaderboard even if they were.

- Tab completion turn off
- No AI used to develop the algorithm of the solution
- AI for boiler plate code is ✅

The intent is to leave the hard, fun part for the human and leave rote, un-fun part for the computer. This feels like the essence of software development to me.

## Running a Day

Most days can be run from the command line using Python 3:

```bash
python day-01.py --input input/day-01/part-one
```

Adjust the day number and input path as needed.
